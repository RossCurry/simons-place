# simons-place [visit](https://simons-place-production.up.railway.app/)
Here's a collection of my Dad's morning coffees at [Simon's place](https://goo.gl/maps/4MHbh9nvFP8Uqooe9), Dublin, where he goes almost every Thursday.

## Deployment
I'm using [Railway](https://railway.app/) to deploy. Setup was pretty easy. Good for server deployment.

## Image CDN
I've used [UploadCare](https://app.uploadcare.com/) to host the images. This came with a really nice API.

## Vanilla NodeJS Server
I've used just plain auld [Node Http module](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html) as a server. It was fun to not use a framework.
